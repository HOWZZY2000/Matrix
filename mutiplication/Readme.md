## Matrix Mutiplication

The function takes two array of double as well as int n, m, p to indicate they are two m X n, n X p matrixs,

then print the result matrix

The sample  
A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];  
B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 6, 5, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11];  
m = 3;     
n = 3;   
p = 4;  

result in:  
│39 41 43 45│  
│87 92 97 102│  
|135 143 151 159|
